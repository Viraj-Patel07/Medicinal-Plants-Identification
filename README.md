# Medicinal Plant identification using No-Code / Low-Code technique

#### Aim: 

To build and train a model that can identify medicinal plants by inserting a picture by an end user who is either a farmer or has no technical background.

#### Datasets:
1. Image dataset: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/748f8jkphb/3
2. Crop information: (1) Wikipedia, (2) NRCSS: https://nrcss.icar.gov.in/

#### Dependencies:
* Orange Data Mining Platform: https://orangedatamining.com/
* Datasets mentioned above

#### Workflow steps:
1. Download and install Orange software from a given site.
2. Run the software and download the Image analytics add-on from the add-ons tab.
3. Download the given folder from this repository.
4. Download the dataset from the given link.
5. Split dataset into train and test data (Train-test split ratio is 80-20% ideally)
6. Open the module given in the folder.
7. in every node, change the paths of the file accordingly.
8. Run the model
